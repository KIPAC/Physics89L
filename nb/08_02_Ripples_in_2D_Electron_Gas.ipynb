    "This notebook will go through an application of the Fourier transform to decipher the electronic properties of a specially designed metallic surface. The experimental data will be various images of an atomically flat copper sample that are captured using a device known as a **Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)**. An STM is essentially just a metallic scanning probe or \"tip\" that is moved very precisely across the metal surface. As the tip moves closer to the surface, an electrical current begins to develop between the sample and the tip, and this current is directly proportional to the amount of electrons on that part of the surface. A two-dimensional \"image\" is then constructed by measuring the current while the tip moves along a region of the surface, where points with a large amount of electrons will appear bright and those with less electrons appear dark. An example of such a scan is shown below."

    "Before we get to the electrons, let's try to develop intuition for how the Fourier transform works in 2D. Let's start like we did before with a simple example. The equivalent of a single-frequency sine wave in 2D is a waveform that varies periodically on one axis and remains constant in another. This is called a **plane wave**, and we can decompose any image into its constituent plane waves with varying amplitude and frequency just as we did in the 1D case. What is new here is now these plane waves also differ in the direction that they are oriented. We show a few examples of different plane waves and their corresponding 2D Fourier transforms.\n",

What units are used for the corresponding \"spatial frequency\" in each direction (x and y) in the examples above? Does this make sense in the context of the previous notebook with our time-based signals and Fourier-transformed frequency space plots?  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2 We also have to consider the direction of the plane waves, so now we describe each possible wave not as a single frequency but as a vector with two values corresponding to each axis of the transformed image (written as $k_x$ and $k_y$ above). We call this quantity the \"wavevector,\" and in each example above the wavevector points from the origin to the points with non-zero amplitude (the yellow dots). Why are there two wavevectors for a single plane wave? Hint: consider the symmetry of the plane wave in the original image."

    "\n",
    "If anything is confusing to you feel free to ask, but also feel free to skip this part and read the **simple summary** below, especially if you are short on time. Those who are interested should definitely take a solid state physics course in the future!\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is a fundamental connection between plane waves and the electrons on a metallic surface. Electrons in a metal have the unique property that they are not confined to the nuclei of the atoms in the solid but can travel freely through the material. These \"free\" electrons also exist on the surface of the metal, and the best description of these particles is not as point objects but rather as plane waves that make up the electron sea. This is a direct example of the \"wave-particle duality\" you may have heard of in Quantum Mechanics. We can then relate the wavevector $\\vec{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ of the electronic states to the electron momentum using the reduced Planck constant, $\\vec{p} = \\hbar \\vec{k}$. This is the same way that momentum can be defined for photons even though they are massless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now one fundamental property of electrons that we must consider is that no more than two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, a statement known as the Pauli Exclusion Principle (you may have experience with this rule drawing electrons into atomic orbitals in chemistry class). This means that the electrons on the surface can't all have the same wavevector or energy, and instead we find that they form a continuous band of plane waves with increasing momentum (and thus increasing energy) as the number of electrons increases. Because the total number of electrons is always finite, we must have a largest energy state corresponding to those electrons at the top of the band of states. This energy is known as the Fermi energy, and this value plays a critical role in understanding the electronic nature of the bulk material we are studying (for example, determining if the material is a conductor or an insulator). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for us, the Fermi energy can be determined by studying the waveforms produced by defects inside the 2D electron sea. It can be shown that the electrons that most strongly scatter off of defects on the surface are those with a wavevector very close to the Fermi wavevector, and so we can measure this value by finding the spatial frequency of the ripples in the STM images. This is where the 2D Fourier transform will be useful, because it makes the periodic features of the image easily understood.\n"

    "**SIMPLE SUMMARY**: We don't have to understand all of the details above to figure out the procedure we are going to employ. Basically, we see oscillations in the electron sea that are due to scattering of electrons off of defects on the surface. These oscillations provide us with fundamental information about the material's electronic properties in the same way that ripples in a liquid formed by throwing a rock in it can teach us about the liquid's properties (the surface tension, for example). It turns out that the wavevector describing the electronic ripples can be related to a fundamental energy parameter of the material that determines the bulk electronic behavior and is critical for electronic devices and more advanced quantum-mechanical applications. This is known as the Fermi energy, and we will use 2D Fourier techniques to measure this value for a Copper surface.\n",

Remember how momentum is related to kinetic energy in order to get the right formula, and also use the fact that the electrons in Copper have an effective mass $m_e = 1.01*m_0$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass of an electron (you can look up this value online).
