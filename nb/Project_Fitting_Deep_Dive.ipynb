    "# Gaining a deeper understanding of fitting model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "Throughout the course we have explored fitting model parameters to data. In particular, we fit a linear model with two parameters, a slope and an offset, to data describing the excess photon counts from the Vela pulsar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to deepen the understanding of the math behind the fitting.  To keep the math simple, we will revisit the same data, but we will simplify the model by removing the slope, so that we are only fitting for the offset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in order to fit the model to data, we need to minimize the $\\chi^2$ function. The $\\chi^2$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\chi^2 = \\sum_i (\\frac{n_i - m_i(x)}{\\sigma_i})^2,$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_i$ is the number of counts from week $i$ (i.e., 'excess_counts' in the next cell) and $\\sigma_i$ is uncertainty on that number (i.e., 'sigma_counts' in the next cell). $m_i$ is the model prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the model prediction is simple. $m(x) = p_0$, so $\\chi^2$ reduces to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\chi^2 = \\sum_i (\\frac{n_i - p_0}{\\sigma_i})^2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the first and second partial derivatives of the $\\chi^2$ with respect to $p_0$. Write out your own expression of the first and second derivatives of $\\chi^2$ with respect to $p_0$.  Implement them as functions, plot them, and verify your results by comparing them to the functions that we wrote to compute the derivatives numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicitly solve for the formula for the best fit value of $p_0$, and the uncertainty on $p_0$ ($\\sigma_{p_0}$).  This will give you an expressing for $p_0$ in terms of the $n_i$ and $\\sigma_i$. Show your work. \n",
    "    - Hint: Remind yourself from a previous week how the uncertainty relates to the change in the $\\chi^2$ function with respect to the minimum value). Note you can show that $\\Delta \\chi^2$ as $\\Delta \\chi^2 = a (\\sigma_{p_0})^2$.  For this step, demonstrate that for our case $a = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2\\chi^2}{\\partial p_0^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compare the formulas you derived for $p_0$ and $\\sigma_{p_0}$ to the formulas for taking the weighted average of the data points by inverse variance weighting. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement your formulas for the best-fit values of $p_0$ and $\\sigma_{p_0}$ as functions, evaluate them, and compare the values to those found by a built-in optimizer like `scipy.optimize`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to complete all of these goals (or similar goals if you have your own ideas). Be sure to give detailed explanations of the plots produced and an explanation of the results for each of the goals. If you don't want to type up your math work, you can write it out on a piece of paper and include it as an picture in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- You may want to use `plt.legend()`, as well as the plotting option [`alpha`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html), which controls the transparency of the plot markers and takes a value between 0 and 1, for plotting the analytical and numerical derivative results on the same canvas.\n"
