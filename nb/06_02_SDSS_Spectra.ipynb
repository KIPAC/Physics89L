    "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ([Project page](https://www.sdss.org/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey)) truly changed the way we understand the universe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of 20 years, SDSS observed 35% of the sky and catalogued about 1 billion stars and galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It addition to taking images of such a large part of the sky, SDSS also measures the spectrum of the light from over 4 million objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The spectra are obtained by feeding an individual optical fiber for each target through a hole drilled in an aluminum plate.  The light from the fiber is then passed into a diffraction grating to seperate out the different wavelength so that the spectrum for that target can be measured.   The diffracted light was then directed to an array of sensors, so that each sensor measured the amount of light at a different wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hole is positioned specifically for a selected target, so every field in which spectra are to be acquired requires a unique plate.  In spectroscopic mode, the telescope tracks the sky in the standard way, keeping the objects focused on their corresponding fiber tips. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture of one such aluminum plate:\n",
    "\n",

    "We are going to be looking at the data from one fiber for one plate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the wavelength of atomic emission lines observed from our target to the known wavelengths of those lines we can measure the doppler shift of the light from that target."
