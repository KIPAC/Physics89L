    "Over the course of 20 years, SDSS observed 35% of the sky and catalogued about 1 billion stars and galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to taking images of such a large part of the sky, SDSS also measures the spectrum of the light from over 4 million objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The spectra are obtained by feeding an individual optical fiber for each target through a hole drilled in an aluminum plate.  The light from the fiber is then passed into a diffraction grating to separate out the different wavelengths. The diffracted light was then directed to an array of sensors, so that each sensor measured the amount of light at a different wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each hole is positioned specifically for a selected target, so every field in which spectra are to be acquired requires a unique plate. In spectroscopic mode, the telescope tracks the sky in the standard way, keeping the objects focused on their corresponding fiber tips. \n",

    "We can measure the distance of objects by taking advantage of the Doppler shift and what we know about atomic emission lines. Atomic transitions result in the emission of known wavelengths of light. Because the targets are moving with respect to earth, these wavelengths will be shifted. We can measure this Doppler shift of the light from a given target object."
