    "# Searching for the Higgs boson\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of this project is to search for the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson was discovered in July 2012 by two experiments, the ATLAS and CMS experiments. It was the last particle to be experimentally discovered in the Standard Model. The Standard Model is a theory describing how fundamental particles interact through the weak, electromagnetic, and strong forces. This figure from [Quanta magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-map-of-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics-20201022/) depicts the Standard Model particles:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/StandardModel.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To discover the Higgs boson, protons were collided at a center-of-mass energy of 7 and 8 TeV. When protons are collided at such a high energy, the protons \"break up\" into their constituent particles (called quarks and gluons). These constituent particles interact in a variety of ways according to the Standard Model and can produce other particles. The ATLAS and CMS experiments are huge detectors which measure these outgoing particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in weeks 7 of this course we searched for dark matter in a simplified data set. In spirit this is similar to the dark matter search, but there are several key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detectors:** The detectors at CERN that were used to discover the Higgs particle are the size of a 6 story building (about 50 m long and 25 m tall).  The detectors surround the collision point, and are constructed to fully image the particles that are produced when two protons collide at very nearly the speed of light.  Sophisticated trigger and data analysis techniques are used to filter the data in order to find events that might have contained a Higgs boson.  \n",
    "2. **What to look for:** \n",
    "- The Higgs boson is unstable, and decays too quickly to other particles (the predicted lifetime is $\\approx10^{-22}$ seconds) to be directly \"imaged\". As such, physicists look for events with particles that are consistent with coming from the Higgs boson decay.  The Higgs can decay to a number of different particles, but we will be looking at decays to two photons. \n",
    "- In the dark matter search in Week 7, we used the **S2** variable (the size of the electron charge signal) to distinguish signal from background.  For the Higgs search we will instead be looking at the **mass** of the parent particle which decayed into two photons.  \n",
    "- For background events that mass will look like a falling distribution, and we will model it as a linear function.  For signal events that mass will be peaked distribution, centered at the mass of the Higgs particle ( $m_{H} = 125.1 \\frac{\\rm GeV}{c^2}$ ).   This means that in the Higgs search, we will be cutting on both sides of the signal. In other words, the signal events are $ | m - m_{H} | < w $, where $w$ is the width of the cut window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Signal and background yield:** In this search, we have much more data, even at the last step of the data analysis.  Both the rate of signal events and background events are much higher than for the dark matter search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try two different ways of doing the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Cut and count\":**  \n",
    "- The general idea is to define what we call a signal region (or a region enriched in signal events), and a background region (a region enriched in background events), and to show that there are more events in the signal region that in the background region.\n",
    "- This would be straightforward if our background rate was constant as a function of mass. Then you can simply pick a window around where you expect a peak to be as the signal region, and another window far away from the peak, of the same width, as the background region. \n",
    "- In our case, since the background is not constant, you can consider picking two background regions, one on either side of the signal, and to average them. Or you can come up with a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/higgs_cut_and_count_2.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"Fitting\":** \n",
    "- Pick a function to model your signal, and a separate one to model your background.\n",
    "- Fit your models to the data, and use the results to extract the size of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Higgs_Mass_fit.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison, here is a figure from the Higgs discovery paper from the ATLAS experiment:\n",

    "### Potential goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Optimize the width of the cut window for the best significance for discovering the Higgs boson. To do this, define a metric that quantifies your expected significance given the expected numbers of signal and background events, and explain why you chose this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply the \"cut and count\" analysis to the real data and calculate the significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plot the increase in significance, that you expect as a function of time using the \"cut and count\" analysis. In other words, how would your ability to discover the Higgs scale with more data? Come up with a formula that describes the increase vs time. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply the \"fitting\" analysis to the real data and come up with a way to quantify the significance of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare the results of the \"fitting\" analysis with the \"cut and count\" analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try to complete all of these goals (or similar goals if you have your own ideas). We have written much of the code for you, so be sure to explain each plot and number that you make thoroughly."
