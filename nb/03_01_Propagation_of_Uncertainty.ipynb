    "Distances, on the other hand, are much harder to measure. As you can see in the Hubble plot, the uncertainties in measured distances can be large, and they tend to get larger as we look at more distant objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that there is no single technique that can measure distances at all these different scales. Astronomers estimate distances mainly by using \"standard candles,\" which are objects that have a known luminosity. The distance of these objects can be inferred from the brightness that we observe on Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty with this method is that different types of standard candles are needed at different distance scales. Measuring a very distant object depends on accurately calibrating the standard candles at all the length scales in between! This is why the technique is called the \"distance ladder\" -- every time you go up a rung (distance scale) on the ladder, you have to calibrate using measurements from the previous rung. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the various techniques and standard candles used by astronomers are shown in the figure below. You can imagine how small uncertainties can start to add up as you go farther up the ladder. This is the idea we'll be exploring in this notebook.\n",

    "The last formula tells us that in this case we can obtain an estimate of the relative uncertainty $\\frac{\\delta A}{A}$ by taking the square root of quantities related to the relative uncertainties of each of the input measurments. Adding the squares of quantities and then taking the square root of the sum is often referred to as \"adding in quadrature.\"\n",

    "1. If a quantity is the product of a bunch of measurements, you can add the *relative* uncertainties of those measurements ($\\delta_i/x_i$) in quadrature to estimate the *relative* uncertainty on the quantity of interest $f$\n",

Explain what exactly is being calculated in each case, and show that the numerical results we got match the formula. Explain in words the difference between the outcomes in the three cases.\n",
