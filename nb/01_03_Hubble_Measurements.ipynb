That can be a bit confusing, but you can think of it as: \"An object 1 Mpc away from us will be moving away from us at $H_0$ km/s, an object twice as far away will be moving away from us twice as fast, and so on.\"\n",

We regularly detect galaxies that are over a billion light years away from us, and which are moving away from us at a large fraction of the speed of light.  We will talk more about this later in the course.\n",
