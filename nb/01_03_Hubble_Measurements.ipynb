That can be a bit confusing, but you can thinking of it as: \"An object 1 Mpc away from use will be moving away from us at $H_0$ km / s, an object twice as far away will be moving away from us twice as fast.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A Megaparsec is about 3,260,000 light years, and is about the distance to the closest Galaxies.  We regularly detect galaxies that are over a billion light years away from us, and which are moving away from us at a large fraction of the speed of light.  We will talk more about this later in the course.\n",
