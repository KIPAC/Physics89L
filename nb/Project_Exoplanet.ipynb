    "# Project: searching for exoplanets\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in weeks 8 of this course we explored analyzing data in the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is quite powerful, and in fact is the basis of how many searches for exoplanets are done.\n",
    "In fact, this was the technique used to discover many of the first exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This techniques is based on the idea that an planet will have a slight effect on its star's orbit.  Recall that in a two body system, the two bodies actually orbit around the center of mass of the combined system.  Even though the star will typically have much more mass that the planet, the center of mass of the combined system will not be exactly at the center of mass of the star.  This will cause the star to \"wobble\".  In technical terms, we say that the radial velocity of the star will vary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then astronomers use the spectral techniques we studying the second notebook of week 6 to measure the relative velocity of a star to extremely high precicsion to detect this wobble.  This variation is actually very small, maybe only dozens of $m / s$ for the first exoplanets discovered, and down to $10 cm / s$ for current state of the art telescopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that allows us to be fully confident that we are seeing a real signal is that the wobble is periodic.  Thus, by doing the analysis in the frequency domain, we can confirm the periodic signature of the wobble. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will consider to effect that can make it easier or harder to detect a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The quality of the measurements.  We will smear out the measurements of the radial velocity, thus degrading the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The number of measurements.  The longer we observe a star for, and the more measurement we take, the more chances we have to confirm the periodic signature in the radial velocity variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a few simple functions, including function to degrade the date, extract the Fourier transform the of the data, and quantify both size of the signal peak and the amount of background in the Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things that you might try and do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run through the four cases in this notebook that demonstrate idealized data, and what happens as it gets degraded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Come up with a way to define the significance of the peak in the Fourier transform and decide if constitues a discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explore how the significance changes as we degrade the data, and characterize those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Come up with a formula to estimate how long we might have to observe to discover an exoplanet if we have a given amount of noise in our measurement of the radial velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun fact: the idealized data we have are using the period and radial velocity of 51 pegasi b the first exoplanet ever discovered around a \"normal\" or \"main sequence\" star.\n",
