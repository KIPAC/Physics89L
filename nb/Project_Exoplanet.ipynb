    "# Searching for Exoplanets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in week 8 of this course, we explored analyzing data in the frequency domain using Fourier transforms. In this project, you will further explore this concept by applying some of the basic statistical techniques that we covered at the beginning of the course, but now in the frequency domain. Fourier analysis has many applications in physics and astronomy, and in this project, you will investigate its use in the search for exoplanets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are now many methods for detecting exoplanets, but the first exoplanet discoveries in the late 1980s and early '90s were made using the *radial velocity method*. This technique is based on the fact that the gravitational force from an exoplanet will have a small, but measurable, effect on the motion of the host star. Recall that in a planetary system, both the planet and the star will orbit around the center of mass of the system. Even though the star will typically have much more mass that the planet, the center of mass of the combined system will not be exactly at the center of mass of the star. This will cause the star to \"wobble\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the Doppler effect, this slight wobble will cause small shifts in the spectrum of the host star over time. These radial velocities can be very small -- the first exoplanets discovered had velocities of just a few m/s -- so measurements of the spectrum must be extremely precise. This measurement technique is summarized in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Radial-Velocity-Method-star-orbits.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to detecting these extremely small shifts and distinguishing them from background fluctuations is that they will be periodic. This is why Fourier analysis is such a powerful technique for analyzing this type of data. When we look at the data in the time domain, it may not be possible to pick out the periodic signal from the background. When we convert to the frequency domain, however, a small periodic signal can become quite obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will consider some effects that can make it easier or harder to detect a periodic signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The quality of the measurements. We will study this effect by adding noise to the measurements of radial velocity, thus degrading the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The number of measurements over time. If we take more measurements over a longer time range, it will be easier to distinguish the periodic signal from background.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a data sample to use in your investigation. This is idealized data, based on radial velocity measurements taken from [51 Pegasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/51_Pegasi) in 1995, which led to the first discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential goals for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run through the four cases in this notebook that demonstrate the effects of adding noise and reducing the observation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decide how to characterize the statistical significance of the peak in the Fourier transform, and whether it constitutes a discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explore how the statistical significance changes as we degrade the data, and discuss your findings using both text and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Imagine you are conducting an exoplanet search using a detector with a known level of noise. Estimate the minimum observation time you need to make a discovery with a high degree of confidence (i.e. at least 5$\\sigma$)?\n",
    "\n",
    "These four goals are suggestions, and you should feel free to substitute your own ideas, as long as your overall project has a similar level of complexity to the listed goals. We have provided a few functions and code templates that you will probably find useful, and you are encouraged to use these as starting points for writing your own code. Four scenarios are briefly discussed to illustrate some of the effects of degradation on the data to get you started."
